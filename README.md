# calculatorClass

project goal was to demonstrate mastery of classes.
I created a calculator class that takes a string and parses
the string to display the correct output

issues so far are negative (subtraction) numbers ie:
3-4 parses as (3)(-4) rather than (3) (-) (4)
add,multiply,divide functionality works.

todo: 
*fix parsing with subtraction
*implement parenthesis
